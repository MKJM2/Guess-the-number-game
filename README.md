# Guess-the-number-game
A really simple game that makes the user guess the number randomly picked by the script itself. 

The code could have been written a lot better and cleaner. However, its purpose is not to look good or be lightning fast. 
Its only purpose is for learning. In this specific example, defining functions and 
actually using them for the first time in my "programming life".
